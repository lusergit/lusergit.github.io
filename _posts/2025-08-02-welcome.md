Hi! Mic check here, first post. Apparently every dev is required ot have some sort of personal blog. I have no personality, which means that I'm following everyone's example and I'll open this blog. My idea is to keep this space for funny things I learn, no matter the topic (cooking? music? yes.)

Enjoy! Or don't!
