Hi! I'm Luca. I'm an italian backend developer, currently working in the `elixir` ecosystem, but considering myself an embedded-curious.

## ヽ(°〇°)ﾉ education years
I graduated from the University of Padova (here's their [CMS-managed website](https://www.unipd.it/)) in 2024, with a master thesis in abstract interpretation, with a focus on termination of the interpreter depending on the features of the abstract domain ([here the source](https://github.com/lusergit/master-thesis)).

## _〆(・ω・。) retirement
Unfortunately to retire you first need to work, so I'm at step 1 of this journey. I now work as a backend engineer (yes, information duplication) in the elixir ecosystem, spawning servers and looking at supervision trees to handle thousands of devices form all around the globe with virtually no downtime and eventual consistency.
